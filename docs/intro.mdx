# OrioleDB: The next-generation storage engine for PostgreSQL

OrioleDB is a PostgreSQL extension that provides a pluggable storage engine for PostgreSQL. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the existing storage engine in PostgreSQL, providing a more flexible and extensible storage layer.

## Example

OrioleDB uses Postgres Table Access Method (TAM) to provide a pluggable storage engine for PostgreSQL. Here is an example of how you can create a table using OrioleDB:

```sql
CREATE TABLE blog_post
(
    id int8 NOT NULL,
    title text NOT NULL,
    body text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
) USING orioledb;
```

## Pluggable Storage in PostgreSQL

Pluggable storage gives developers the ability to use different storage engines for different tables within the same database. Developers will be able to choose a storage method that is optimized for their specific needs: some tables could be configured for high transactional loads, others for analytics workloads, and still others for archiving.

Something like this is already available in MySQL, which uses the `InnoDB` as the default storage engine since MySQL 5.5. This replaced `MyISAM`.

Read more about the history of pluggable storage [here](https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-pluggable-strorage).

## Using OrioleDB

OrioleDB currently requires a set of patches to PostgreSQL to enable the pluggable storage engine. All of these patches have been submitted to the PostgreSQL community and are currently under review. Once these patches are accepted, OrioleDB will be able to run on any PostgreSQL installation without any modifications.
